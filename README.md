### Notes
1. Put on corners of the two topmost layers to kill chicken jockeys
1. 4 alarm piglins should be sufficient
1. Replaces slabs around AFK spot under glass blocks; place to 1 layer above bottom stair
1. Placed on carpets in AFK zone to attract piglins that spawn unaggroed

## Tweaks (1.18+)
- The farm must be built entirely within a Nether Wastes biome.
- The spawning rings must be built out of magma blocks to prevent Piglin spawns. Magma is found plentifully in the Nether from Y=27 to Y=36.
- Iron Golems are no longer necessary, as Magma Cubes cannot spawn in two-block-tall gaps.
- Torches are no longer necessary, as the bug that enabled zombie reinforcements to spawn on glass blocks has been fixed; and it's actually important that there are no torches on or near the spawning rings, as they can now prevent zombified piglin spawns.
- Only ten alarm pigmen in total are necessary; three each at two opposing corners, and two each at the others, per ilmango's fix video.
(Note that replacing the slabs at the corners of the center area with snow layers per ilmango's fix video is no longer necessary, as the pathfinding bug with baby zombified piglins has been fixed. Also, using turtle eggs to bait zombie reinforcements into the minecarts isn't necessary, as they shouldn't be able to spawn in the first place.)
